 Swagger User Interface (UI) implementation for responsive design for frontend/backend developers for easy and efficient testing of basic APIs of user login/signup CRUD fucntionalities

Phoenix for building APIs

Ecto for handling Database with Postgres
```
# 1 Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feedback_umbrella.git
cd feedback_umbrella

# 2Ô∏èFetch dependencies for all apps
mix deps.get

# 3 Setup the database (PostgreSQL)
mix ecto.create        # create DB
mix ecto.migrate       # run migrations
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs   # optional: seed DB

# 4 Start Phoenix server for API app
cd apps/api
mix phx.server

# The API will run at: http://localhost:4000
# Swagger docs available at: http://localhost:4000/api/docs

# 5Ô∏è Example cURL requests
# Fetch all feedbacks
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/feedbacks" -H "accept: application/json"

# Fetch feedbacks filtered by email
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/feedbacks?email=tester@gmail.com" -H "accept: application/json"

# Fetch feedbacks by date range
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/feedbacks?from=2025-08-01&to=2025-08-20" -H "accept: application/json"

# Fetch feedbacks ordered ascending by first name
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/feedbacks?order=asc" -H "accept: application/json"

# To get all above APIs at one page and use by Swagger UI

http://localhost:4000/api/docs


# This page of Swagger UI will show to user on above URL:


Here is homepage to get an idea about implementation of APIs in swagger
